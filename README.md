# Welcome to the Founders & Coders applicants' community

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/FACapplicants/facapplicants.github.io](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/FACapplicants/facapplicants.github.io?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

This space is for past, current and future applicants to the Founders & Coders programmes.

Please do continue to work on the [course prerequisites](http://foundersandcoders.org/apply), but meanwhile, please join the Gitter chat using the link above and introduce yourself.

When you feel ready (perhaps after you have completed the [JavaScript track on Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/javascript) or read a few chapters of [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)), then start working on [Codewars](http://www.codewars.com/). 

When you have made a bit of progress with Codewars, try [creating a new kata](http://www.codewars.com/kata/new/javascript) and posting it to Gitter or trying to solve kata posted into our Gitter channel by other members.

If you have any questions, please post them into Gitter and we will do our best to answer them (or point you to somebody who can).
